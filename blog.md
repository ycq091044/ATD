# Self-supervised Tensor Decomposition for Better Downstream Classification

This blog is written to introduce a recent NeurIPS 2022 paper: **ATD: Augmenting CP Tensor Decomposition by Self Supervision.** 

The paper introduces a new canonical polyadic tensor decomposition (CPD) approach empowered by self-supervised learning (SSL), which generates unsupervised embeddings that gives better downstream classification performance.
